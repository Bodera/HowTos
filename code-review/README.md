# Code Reviews

The main focus of a code review relies on:

- Functionality
- Code formatting
- Naming conventions
- Consistency
- Simplicity
- Unused code
- Praise your peers

Code reviews are about: 

- Quality: Ensuring the code meets the project's quality standards, is well-written, and is easy to understand and maintain.
- Correctness: Verifying that the code functions as intended and produces the expected results.
- Security: Identifying potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring the code is secure.
- Design: Evaluating the overall design of the code, including its structure, organization, and adherence to design principles.
- Maintainability: Assessing how easy it will be to modify and extend the code in the future.
- Testability: Checking if the code is easily testable and has sufficient test coverage.
- Best Practices: Confirming that the code follows established coding conventions, best practices, and coding standards.
- Collaboration: Facilitating knowledge sharing and improving the overall team's coding skills.

Code review are not about:

- Personal Attacks: Code reviews should focus on the code, not the individual who wrote it.
- Nitpicking: Don't focus on minor style issues unless they significantly impact readability or maintainability.
- Ego Battles: Avoid getting into arguments about subjective preferences.
- Micromanagement: Trust the developer to make decisions within the scope of their role.
- Blame: The goal is to improve the code, not to find fault with the developer.
- Unnecessary Delays: Reviews should be timely and efficient.
- Perfect Code: Code reviews are about finding and addressing issues, not achieving perfection.
- Rewriting Code: Reviews should focus on suggesting improvements, not rewriting the entire codebase.

## When reviewing you should

- Explain what you want and why
- Provide examples to attend the requirements
- Ask the author to a private talk where you can elaborate further - this is called over shoulder review
- Try to use the Sandwich review approach (positive comment - constructive comment - positive comment)
